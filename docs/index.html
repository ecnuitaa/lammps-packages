    <h1>Building and Installing LAMMPS Precompiled Packages</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      The LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation packages is usually
      installed and customized by its users from source code, which can
      be obtained from its
      <a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov" target="_blank">Sandia home page</a>
      as tar archives or from its
      <a href="http://gihub.com/lammps/lammps/" target="_blank">GitHub
        project page</a> as snapshot zip archive or git repository clone.
      However, for bignners, or people wanting to try something out quickly,
      or for tutorials, or for people running on platforms like windows,
      where compilers are not as commonly and conveniently available,
      having precompile LAMMPS packages can be very convenient and helpful.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">The purpose of this webpage is to provide access
    to such precompiled packages that have been curated by the LAMMPS
    developers and contain as complete a set of features as technically
    meaningful and legally possible with the restrictions on some of the
    licenses for add-on libraries (typically the burden for the latter
    is higher for precompiled and bundled binaries, than for source code
      packages obtained from different sources).
    </p>
    <p align="justify"> The second part of this webpage is to document
      the tools and scripts used in the process of building these packages
      and descrbing the process or building the packages or repositories,
      so that people can go about and customize it or contribute solutions
      or iproved, alternate approaches for the procedures used.

    <h3><a href="windows.html">Installer packages for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows</a></h3>
    <p align="justify">These packages are executables containing
      a <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
        Nullsoft scriptable installer</a> for Windows versions from
      Windows XP (SP2) to Windows 10. The packages are available for
      32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems, with and without support for
      MPI (a link for a compatible MPI library installer is provided).
      These packages also contain several PDF format files with the
      LAMMPS manual and associated documentation, most of the example
      inputs, bundled potential files, benchmark input and some tools.
